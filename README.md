# Credit Card Fraud Detection

**Credit Card Fraud Detection** is a machine learning project that uses classification models to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. This project employs techniques such as data balancing, model evaluation, and confusion matrix analysis to achieve accurate predictions.

## 🕵️ Features

- Detects fraudulent transactions from anonymized credit card data.
- Handles class imbalance using techniques like undersampling or SMOTE.
- Uses models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest.
- Evaluates performance using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**
- **Required Libraries**:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

Install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vinayakrai/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection.git
cd Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
```

2. **Run the Notebook**:

Use Jupyter Notebook or VS Code to open:

```bash
credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb
```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Load and explore the dataset.
2. Preprocess and balance the data.
3. Train classification models.
4. Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Visualize results using confusion matrix and plots.
